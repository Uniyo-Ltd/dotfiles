## My humble nvim config

I use it to code mainly in Flutter, C++ & Rust.

It contains cool support for LaTeX, that's why instead of comprehensive readme, there is [PDF File](https://github.com/wzslr321/nvim-config/blob/main/main.pdf) which lists all the plugins and is my small personal cheatsheet for keybindings.

### What do I use?


#### Main things:

- Terminal: iTerm2
- Editor: Neovim
- File Manager: yazi
- Shell: zsh
- Terminal Workspace: Zellij
- Git: Lazygit

---

Besides these *bigger* tools, I also decided to list things I often use, but these do not require a specific config.

// Fill those
- bat | `cat` with cool syntax highlighting
- fd | `find` alternative
- gh | GitHub in command line
